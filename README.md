# HTML 101, the first episode
Welcome to your first assignment! Here you'll be able to apply to practice the very basics of the HTML language.

## What you'll be doing
A super simple page where you talk about one of your interests!

## Rules
Your page must have each of the following:
- A title
- A level one section heading
- A paragraph
- A link to an external website
- Two images, one which is normal and one that leads to an external website

You are free to add more, but everything listed above is absolutely required.

## Extra challenge (optional)
Does your page feel like one of those blogs from the late 90s? Let's give it some style!\
You can achieve this either with the ```<style>``` tag in your HTML file, or use a separate CSS file.

## What I'll be looking at
I'm not picky, but I'll still pay very close attention to these:
- Overall HTML structure
- Proper use of elements, including headings, paragraphs, images, etc...
- [Extra challenge] Overall appearance and readability of your page

## How to submit
Fork this repository on your profile and push you work on the newly created fork.
